# Bounty Escrow

## Description

- This package contains Plutus source code for Bounty and Escrow Project.
  
- This is a bounty campaign that is been managed by PPBL students which they will create task for other students in form of bounty and then reward participant.

- Running bounty escrow campaign on blockchain have these advantages:
    1. If a participant try to use ill-practice behavior for any bounty, the participant will be disqualified and their funds which was locked inside smart contract will be taken by campaign management.
    2. The rules set out in these bounties are not fixed and according to the bounty it is flexible and changeable and the participants will be rewarded accordingly and no negotiation will be needed.
    3. Commit to a bounty is handled by on-chain action, therefore the campaign can be used worldwide and as transparent as possible.
    4. Right now, submission acceptance and approval of successful bounty is implemented off-chain, which means participants must contact campaign management in order to get rewarded. [Gimbalabs implementation of Bounty Escrow off-chain code (front-end)](https://gitlab.com/gimbalabs/gimbal-bounty-treasury-and-escrow/gimbal-tracker-v1)
    5. Credential (access) token logic is implemented inside this project therefore only participants who authenticated and authorized by campaign management are able to commit to a bounty, that said, campaigns management is responsible for distributing its credential token.
    6. Since 2 smart contracts (Treasury and Escrow) was implemented, the result of this design pattern offer more security and less unwanted result(broken bounty) than normal bounty escrow smart contracts.

- There are lot more advantages for such smart contract usage, so we strongly encourage students to change and improve the business logic of these smart contracts.
  
## Installation

Once you have Plutus development environment, to compile the smart contracts follow these instructions:
  
- Run `nix-shell` inside `plutus-app` folder
- Change directory to `ppbl-course-02/project-303/Bounty Escrow`
- Then execute `cabal update` command

## Usage

Follow these steps to make smart contracts ready for compilation:

### Step 1

Mint a reward token that will be paid to participant of bounty, and save the `PolicyId` and `TokenName`. These will be used for `bountyTokenPolicyId`, `bountyTokenName`,`tBountyTokenPolicyId` and `tBountyTokenName` of contracts parameter. How many tokens depends on you, so feel free to test boundaries of token generation, but keep in mind the **Hard Limit**.

### Step 2

Create and make ready a minting contract that will be used for credential (access) token, the `PolicyId` must be constant but `TokenName` will be based on participant username or ID. So each time you need to mint **ONE** new credential token for new participants. This will be used for `accessTokenPolicyId` and `tAccessTokenPolicyId` contracts parameter.

### Step 3

Provide a wallet and obtain its payment public hash to be used as `treasuryIssuerPkh` in treasury contract.

### Step 4

At file `EscrowCompiler.hs` provide values for  `writeBountyEscrowScript` function parameters

### Step 5

Run `cabal repl` and check there is no error (you can ignore warnings although it is good practice to solve those too)

### Step 6

Run `writeBountyEscrowScript` and get `Right()` as output which indicate **Bounty Escrow** contract was complied successfully.

### Step 7

Obtain contract address and contract hash (policy ID) by running this command

### Step 8

Provide values for `writeBountyTreasuryScript` function parameters based on all the data you've gather and then compile treasury contract by running `writeBountyTreasuryScript` inside repl and get `Right()` as output which indicate **Bounty Treasury** contract was complied successfully.

## Design patterns

- After obtaining treasury contract address, create bounty (task) with correct Datum and send bounty detail as metadata inside a that transaction.

- Participants who obtained credential (access) token will be able to consume eUTxO at **Treasury** contract and produce output at **Bounty** contract address, which indicate they are committed to the bounty.

- Bounty campaign manager will consume eUTxO at **Bounty** contract and send the reward to participants who successfully completed the bounty or send the reward back to **Treasury** contract upon unsuccessful completion of bounty.

## Tooling

There are 2 scripts at `/app` folder for creating correct **Datum** or **Redeemer** for these smart contract, so `cardano-cli` or front-end transactions crafting will be possible. The outcome of these scripts are same but different in obtaining values, one has hardcoded values and other one gets value from command line.

Feel free to use either and choose one to optimize and create different **Datum** and **Redeemer** with it. Note that the values are just examples.

Inside `/project-303/Bounty Escrow` folder run:

- `dataToJSON-Hardcoded.hs`
  
```bash
cabal run dataToJSON-Hardcoded
```

- `dataToJSON-WithArg.hs`

```bash
cabal run dataToJSON-WithArg "22117fbd0f86a213ae4f4d824cd0d38eea29e49764ae22f5f50ba3d3" "e02f8dd57e378ee673d5bf3bf7228382f131b1767d588a79cde2726a" 20 25000 1651252695000
```

## Note

- All values are just examples.
- All output files will be written to `/Bounty Escrow/output` directory.
- Feel free change, optimize and experiment with all codes and scripts, especially try to create different **Datum** and **Redeemer**.
